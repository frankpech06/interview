# Interview


Interested in joining to the Yellowme team? We believe that a great way for you to show us who you are is with your code. Completing a project has many benefits:

* **You have code to share.** Maybe your current employer doesn't allow you to show us what you've been working on, or maybe you just finished school or a developer bootcamp and haven't established a portfolio. Now you have code to show us.

* **Express yourself.** Interviews can be stressful and people get nervous. Working on a project without the watchful eye of an interviewer gives you the chance to show us your best work.
 
* **Everyone works on the same project.** All job candidates work on the same set of projects. This allows us to look at everyone objectively based on their work.

## Getting Started
### 1. Pick a Project

Each type of technology that we use at Yellowme has a representative folder within
this repository. The folder contains a `README.md` with a description of the
project we would like you to build.

We currently offer the following projects:

- [Front-end](front_end)
- [iOS](ios)
- [Android](android)
- [Back-end](back_end)

### 2. Create a New Repository

Since we don't offer a starting point for any of the projects, create a new
repository on your GitHub account. It can be public or private.

### 3. Commit Often

At Yellowme, we like to commit often. This helps document your thought process and
makes it much easier to revert a change that causes a bug.

### 4. Have Fun

This is your chance to express yourself. If you have knowledge of technologies
that you think will help with completing the project, use them. We love learning
just as much as you!

## Need Help?
